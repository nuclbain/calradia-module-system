[!] If you are the author of any of the resources used in the module system and i forgot to credit you, please contact me and i will add you to the list. Same goes for people that want me to remove their resources from the module system, just contact me and i will do it. Sorry for any kind of inconvenience, this mod started and was developed for personal use and i never thought it would be released to the public (if it really is :D).
